# 🚀 Day 3: SkillMatcher UI Cleanup & Deployment Prep

## Project Overview Update

**Goal:** Enhance the MVP's user interface for presentability and prepare the backend for future deployment, without deploying it today.

## 🔧 Day 3 Tasks & Execution Log

### UI Cleanup & Home Page Enhancement

  - **Goal:** Improve the visual appeal of the frontend using only Tailwind CSS, and make the Home page functional.

#### 1\. UI Cleanup (Max 90 Minutes)

  - Applied Tailwind CSS classes to improve padding, margins, and visual separation.
  - Utilized `card`, `border`, and `shadow` classes for better visual grouping of content on results and input pages.
  - Ensured buttons had appropriate styles to clearly indicate clickability.
  - Made the input page clean and minimal, focusing on the input field and submit button.
  - **Status:** ✅ Done

#### 2\. Add Home Page Content

  - **`pages/Home.jsx`:**
      - Added "SkillMatcher" as the project name.
      - Included a tagline: "Find your next move with your current skills."
      - Created a "Get Started" button that navigates to the `/input` page upon click.
      - **Example Snippet Added:**
        ```jsx
        <button
          onClick={() => navigate("/input")}
          className="mt-6 px-6 py-2 bg-blue-600 text-white rounded"
        >
          Get Started
        </button>
        ```
  - **Status:** ✅ Done

### Deployment Preparation

  - **Goal:** Deploy the frontend to a live URL and prepare the backend for future deployment.

#### 3\. Frontend Deployment (Vercel)

  - Logged into Vercel using GitHub.
  - Imported the `skillmatcher` repository.
  - Selected the `frontend` directory as the root folder.
  - Configured build command as `npm run build`.
  - Configured output directory as `dist`.
  - Successfully deployed the frontend.
  - **Live URL:** [https://skill-matcher-zbv6.vercel.app/input](https://skill-matcher-zbv6.vercel.app/input) (Note: The home page is at root `/`, but the provided link directly points to the input page, confirming deployment).
  - **Status:** ✅ Done (Live URL provided)

#### 4\. Backend Deployment Prep (Railway)

  - Created `requirements.txt` by running: `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.
  - Modified `backend/settings.py` to temporarily allow all hosts: `ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['*']`.
  - Confirmed the project runs correctly with: `python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000`.
  - **Status:** ✅ Done (Preparation complete, awaiting instructions for actual deployment)

## 🧠 Learning Summary (So Far)

  - A clear understanding of how React and Django connect via API has been established.
  - Gained experience in using a local JSON file as a source for dynamic data in the backend.
  - Learned how to make React pages interact with Django Rest Framework endpoints.
  - Developed an understanding of how to map the structured data from the backend to a dynamic UI in the frontend.
