# üöÄ Day 5: SkillMatcher Final Polish & Ship Prep

## Project Overview Update

**Goal:** Secure backend settings using environment variables, create a comprehensive `README.md`, and prepare the project for public sharing.

-----

## üîß Day 5 Tasks & Execution Log

### Backend Settings Cleanup & Security

  - **Goal:** Move sensitive configurations to environment variables for better security and deployment practices.

#### 1.1 Install `python-decouple`

  - Activated the backend virtual environment.
  - Installed `python-decouple`: `pip install python-decouple`.
  - Updated `requirements.txt`: `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.
  - **Status:** ‚úÖ Done

#### 1.2 Update `settings.py`

  - Added `from decouple import config` at the top of `backend/backend/settings.py`.
  - Updated `SECRET_KEY`, `DEBUG`, and `ALLOWED_HOSTS` to fetch values using `config()`:
    ```python
    SECRET_KEY = config("SECRET_KEY")
    DEBUG = config("DEBUG", default=False, cast=bool)
    ALLOWED_HOSTS = config("ALLOWED_HOSTS", cast=lambda v: [s.strip() for s in v.split(',')])
    ```
  - **Status:** ‚úÖ Done

#### 1.3 Create `.env` file

  - Created a `.env` file in the `SkillMatcher/backend/` directory (same level as `manage.py`).
  - **Content:**
    ```
    SECRET_KEY=your_real_secret_key_here # Replaced with actual key
    DEBUG=False
    ALLOWED_HOSTS=*
    ```
  - **Status:** ‚úÖ Done

#### 1.4 Add `.env` to `.gitignore`

  - Ensured `.env` was added to `SkillMatcher/backend/.gitignore` to prevent it from being committed.
  - Pushed all backend updates (excluding `.env`) to GitHub.
  - **Status:** ‚úÖ Done

#### 1.5 Update Environment Variables on Railway

  - Navigated to the Railway project dashboard.
  - Added/updated variables under "Variables":
      - `SECRET_KEY`: Set to the actual Django secret key.
      - `DEBUG`: Set to `false`.
      - `ALLOWED_HOSTS`: Set to `*`.
  - Triggered a redeploy on Railway to apply the new environment variables.
  - Tested the API to ensure functionality remained intact.
  - **Status:** ‚úÖ Variables added to Railway, deployment works.

### Documentation & Finalization

  - **Goal:** Create a clear and concise `README.md` for the project.

#### 2\. Add a `README.md` to the Repo Root

  - Created `README.md` in the root of the `skillmatcher/` repository.
  - **Content as provided:**
    ````markdown
