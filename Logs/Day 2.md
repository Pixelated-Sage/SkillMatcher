# 🚀 Day 2: SkillMatcher Backend Data-Driven Matching Logic

## Project Overview Update

**Goal:** Transform the backend from dummy logic to a dynamic recommender using `skill_data.json`. Update the frontend to display the structured recommendations.

---

## 🔧 Day 2 Tasks & Execution Log

### Backend Data-Driven Matching Logic

- **Goal:** Integrate `skill_data.json` into the backend for dynamic recommendations.

#### 1. Place the JSON File
- Moved the provided `skill_data.json` file to `SkillMatcher/backend/matcher/skill_data.json`.
- **Status:** ✅ Done

#### 2. Update Backend View to Load JSON
- **`matcher/views.py`:**
  - Imported `json` and `os`.
  - Defined `SKILL_DATA_PATH` to correctly locate `skill_data.json` relative to the current file.
  - Loaded `skill_data.json` into the `skill_data` variable once at startup.
  - Modified the `match_skills` function:
    - Iterated through the `skills` received from the request.
    - For each `skill`, checked if it exists as a key in `skill_data`.
    - If found, assigned the corresponding structured data (careers, courses, teammates) to the `result` dictionary.
    - If not found, assigned default "No data" values for careers, courses, and teammates.
    - Returned the `result` dictionary within a `Response` object.
- **Status:** ✅ Done

#### 3. Restart Server & Test Backend
- Restarted the Django development server: `python manage.py runserver`.
- Tested the API using `curl` with sample skills (`Python`, `C++`).
- Verified that the response structure now includes the full `careers`, `courses`, and `teammates` arrays as expected from `skill_data.json`.
- **Status:** ✅ Done

### Frontend Update (`/results` Page)

- **Goal:** Adapt the frontend's `Results.jsx` to parse and display the new structured data from the backend.

#### 1. Update Rendering in `Results.jsx`
- **`pages/Results.jsx`:**
  - Retained `useEffect` to load `skillResults` from `localStorage`.
  - Updated the rendering logic to iterate over `Object.entries(results)`.
  - For each `skill` and its `info` (which now contains `careers`, `courses`, `teammates`):
    - Created a main `div` for each skill with basic styling (padding, border, shadow).
    - Displayed the `skill` name as a heading.
    - Created separate `div` sections for "Career Paths", "Courses", and "Teammate Roles".
    - Used `map` to render each item within `info.careers`, `info.courses`, and `info.teammates` as list items.
- **Status:** ✅ Done

#### 2. End-to-End Test
- Ensured both backend (`python manage.py runserver`) and frontend (`npm run dev`) servers were running.
- Navigated to `/input` in the browser.
- Entered skills (e.g., "Python, C++, JavaScript").
- Submitted the form and was redirected to `/results`.
- Verified that the page correctly displayed the structured recommendations (career paths, courses, teammate roles) for each entered skill, pulling data from the `skill_data.json` via the backend.
- **Status:** ✅ Connected & Working
